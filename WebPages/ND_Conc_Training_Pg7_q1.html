<div class="learn2_body_txt">Fatima, a student-athlete on the Women's Soccer team, receives a sudden, unexpected blow to her body from an opposing player while they are both chasing down a loose ball.  Although the hit knocks her to the ground and she is out of breath, her head does not contact the ground or the other player.  After catching her breath, Fatima notices a mild headache and experiences blurred vision for a short time.
