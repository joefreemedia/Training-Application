<input type="checkbox" name="situation" value="opt2" id="opt2">B. Since the symptoms are minor, Fatima should continue to play and see if the symptoms get any worse.<br>
<input type="checkbox" name="situation" value="opt3" id="opt3">C. Since she is unsure of the signs, Fatima should only notify her coach if she is specifically asked or removed from play.<br>

<div class="opt_answer" id="opt_answer"><span class="correct_opt">The correct answer is D.</span>By colliding with the other player, Fatima's head may have been injured even if there was no direct impact to the head. Regardless of how minor the symptoms are, she must immediately report any symptoms of a potential concussion. By continuing to play with a possible concussion, Fatima would put herself at serious risk for further injury. Fatima should immediately remove herself from play and notify her coach and/or team physician of the symptoms so she can be evaluated.
